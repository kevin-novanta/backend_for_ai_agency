All of our recruiters have over 44 years of combined experience in the legal industry, and most have worked for top law firms. We are very thorough when screening candidates. We get to know the candidate personally so that we can match each attorney with the ideal law firm. We base this on our own vast knowledge of the legal marketplace, as well as the specifications requested by firms and the attorney's own strengths, personalities, style, personality, work ethics, and geographic needs. We ensure that each attorney we work with is fully suited for any law firm they interview with.We Screen Thousands of Attorneys so Chicago Law Firms Don't Have toWe know what it is like to receive resumes for a position within a law firm from countless potential candidates that don't meet the criteria we're looking for. We know how frustrating it can be to have to wade through hundreds of resumes only to find one or two that are acceptable. Therefore, when we screen our attorneys, we make sure they have all of the credentials and characteristics that the firm is looking for. We not only review each candidate's litigation history, billable hours, and academic success, but we also get to know the attorney intimately. We strive to find perfect fits for both attorneys and law firms.Our Recruiters Meet Applicants Face-to-FaceOur recruiters go above and beyond what other recruiters will do. We meet face to face with our attorney candidates and we walk them through each phase of the recruitment process. We have very creative recruiters and they are able to present our attorney candidates to the law firms with confidence. We keep both the attorney and the law firm fully updated throughout each step of the recruitment process.

"info@masseconomics.com","","","","","The Baron Building, 620 Massachusetts Ave","https://masseconomics.com/","Mass EconomicsMass Economics is a research and consulting firm that specializes in urban economic growth and equity. Mass Economics is a technical firm with expertise in data, analytics, surveying, modeling, and strategy, as well as a mission-driven organization committed to inclusive and equitable economic growth. We work with public, private, and philanthropic institutions, and are nationally known for our work on economic cluster strategies, inclusive and equitable growth, urban land issues, and the creation of models that link economic and physical assets.Inclusion and OpportunityThe past 40 years of economic history have made it clear that economic growth alone does not lead to equality – or even to equal opportunity. Our work aims to ensure that the benefits of economic growth span geographies and demographic groups. Our strategies to increase equality and opportunity have included strengthening neighborhood entrepreneurship and local clusters, leveraging infrastructure investments to reimagine opportunities in disinvested areas, helping train local leaders in neighborhood planning, and identifying underutilized land assets for innovative redevelopment in disinvested areas.Urban/Regional Economic StrategiesCities require broad-based strategies to achieve catalytic change. We work closely with our clients and partners to address foundational economic, land use, and inequality challenges. Our staff led the economic development strategy for one of the largest, most transformative urban strategy projects ever undertaken. We have also addressed repositioning cities in the global economy, addressing the skills and spatial mismatches between employers and employees, and revitalizing core city areas to the benefit of neighborhood residents, as well as the city and region.Innovation and EntrepreneurshipIn the past decade, profound economic, demographic, technological and cultural shifts have radically altered the spatial geography of innovation and increasingly, of opportunity. Our most creative institutions, firms, and workers value proximity and integration so that knowledge can be transferred and built upon quickly and seamlessly. Our diverse population demands more and better choices in where they live, work, and play – across building types, neighborhoods, and jurisdictions. And our more open, networked way of life is shifting and accelerating how firms and people interact, how ideas flow, and how places – from research labs to mixeduse developments to neighborhoods – are designed. Mass Economics’ urban innovation projects reimagine cities for the 21st century, whether we are developing measurement and evaluation frameworks for clients, designing new educational models, developing strategies for Innovation Districts, or convening national experts to discuss the opportunities and challenges of innovation-focused economic development.Urban LandMany urban areas face what might be called a land paradox: vast swaths of blight and vacancy but few developable sites, conditions that exacerbate income and opportunity inequality in cities. Mass Economics works with cities on economic development strategies tailored to absorb available land while recognizing the constraints that land assets impose on short-term growth options. We have worked with urban stakeholders on linking land assets and growth clusters, developing industrial growth strategies, rationalizing industrial land holdings, utilizing land assets to spur economic growth in low- and moderate-income areas, and identifying long-term strategies for reuse of vacant land. Our urban land framework explicates the relationship between land challenges and economic opportunity and provides strategies to address land issues.data-Fabdata-Fab is a data system and analytic platform designed to improve our understanding of urban and regional economiesdata-Fab provides high quality employment estimates by detailed industry for counties, MSAs, and custom geographies across the U.S.data-Fab data cover ~1,000 industries in all U.S. counties for three units of times: annually, quarterly, and monthly","Mass Economics is a research and consulting firm that specializes in urban economic growth and equity."

The son of an owner of a local construction company, Sam has been exposed to construction and development his entire life. Experiencing what it takes to build and run a small business inspired Sam and instilled the value of a strong work ethic, which he employs daily.Sam is also actively engaged in his community. From days at the local soup kitchen, to habitat for humanity projects, to more than 10 overseas trips to Haiti for non-profit work, giving back is one of Sam's biggest passions. Whether you are family, friend, client, or person in need, Sam always strives to put the needs and interests of others in everything he does. This drive to help people in all walks of life, his love and understanding of his community, and his construction experience all led Sam towards real estate.In 2017, Sam decided to pursue obtaining his real estate license in effort to help individuals navigate the quickly evolving Washington DC, VA, and MD markets. His main focus is creating long lasting relationships built on trust, experience, expertise, and a relentless work ethic.

The son of an owner of a local construction company, Sam has been exposed to construction and development his entire life. Experiencing what it takes to build and run a small business inspired Sam and instilled the value of a strong work ethic, which he employs daily.Sam is also actively engaged in his community. From days at the local soup kitchen, to habitat for humanity projects, to more than 10 overseas trips to Haiti for non-profit work, giving back is one of Sam's biggest passions. Whether you are family, friend, client, or person in need, Sam always strives to put the needs and interests of others in everything he does. This drive to help people in all walks of life, his love and understanding of his community, and his construction experience all led Sam towards real estate.In 2017, Sam decided to pursue obtaining his real estate license in effort to help individuals navigate the quickly evolving Washington DC, VA, and MD markets. His main focus is creating long lasting relationships built on trust, experience, expertise, and a relentless work ethic.

GRO Architects has been based in Lower Manhattan for the past 20 years and recently opened our workshop space, GROworks in Jersey City, servicing projects throughout the metropolitan area.. Our projects range in size, program, and complexity; our design portfolio includes several ground-up multi-family residential projects, the design for religious institutions such as the Montgomery Mosque for the Muslim Federation of New Jersey, and the adaptive reuse of historic structures such as our 125,000sf commercial project for Warren at Bay. Our projects always consider the specific needs of the client and site, responding creatively to constraints to propose innovative design solutions. For example, the Nest Micro-Housing project pushes the boundaries to propose the smallest legal dwelling possible in New Jersey, providing an innovative approach to the accommodation of accessible facilities and flexible built-in furnishings, thereby providing an alternative housing option that addresses the growing housing shortage.GRO recently received the 2022 Honor Award from AIA New Jersey for our Nest Micro-Housing project, completed in 2021. Our urban infill prototype, PREttyFAB, won an AIA Merit Award in 2009, a 2010 PCI Design Award in 2010, and was named “Project of the Year” by the Jersey City Redevelopment Agency that same year. In July 2009, Metropolis Magazine named GRO a “Next Gen Notable” for our Docking Stations project. The scheme envisioned a series of publicly accessible floating extensions from Manhattan into the Hudson and East Rivers that powered city street lamps by harnessing river currents. In 2007, GRO won re:Construction, a design competition curated by the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council and sponsored by the Alliance for Downtown New York, with our project “Best Pedestrian Route”. In 2008, the same project also won an AIA New York Merit Award and a New York Designs Award from the Architectural League of New York. The firm’s design work has been published in the New York Times, the (Newark) Star Ledger, Architectural Record, The Architect’s Newspaper, Fast Company, Azure, Dwell, and Metropolis Magazine.Our firm privileges the integration of emerging technologies to respond to client needs, project complexity, and collaboration between disciplines. As architects, we are intimately engaged in providing creative and sustainable design solutions for a broad array of project types and budgets. The virtual design and construction tools we use to realize our design proposals also allow us to bring to each project a more efficient and optimized construction process. Additionally, these tools have allowed us to operate in a highly efficient manner while maintaining a staff of two licensed architects and seven project designers. Through the conceptualization of how new digital protocols augment, challenge, and change the authorial process of design we create novel opportunities for our practice and bring excellence to design.GRO ARCHITECTS, PLLC is a certified NYC M/WBE.NICOLE ROBERTSONAIA, LEED APNicole Robertson is a partner at the award-winning New York-based firm GRO Architects. Robertson was named one of 32 new faces of design in the December 2010 issue of Dwell magazine. She was the ‘Emerging Architect’ Visiting Assistant Professor at Barnard College in 2007 where she taught design studios and advanced seminars with a focus on digital fabrication technology. Prior to joining the faculty at Barnard, she taught as an Assistant Professor in the School of Architecture at Syracuse University. She has taught graduate representation and introductory design studios in the Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation at Columbia University and graduate representation in the School of Constructed Environments at Parsons the New School for Design. Prior to forming GRO, she worked as a project designer for the Embryological House at Greg Lynn FORM in Los Angeles, and later as a senior designer at Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM) in New York. Robertson holds a Bachelor of Arts from Princeton University and a Master of Architecture from the University of California Los Angeles. Robertson is a LEED Accredited Professional and a licensed Architect in New York and New Jersey.RICHARD GARBERAIARichard Garber, AIA, is a founding partner at GRO Architects and faculty member in the Architecture Department at the University of Pennsylvania’s Weitzman School of Design, where he teaches design studios and seminars. GRO’s work privileges the integration of emerging technologies to respond to client needs, project complexity, and collaboration between disciplines. Richard has written numerous books and essays in which he advocates for technology as it relates to formal speculation, simulation, manufacturing, and building delivery to generate innovate design, assembly, and construction solutions. He is the author ofBIM Design: Realizing the Creative Potential of Building Information Modeling(John Wiley & Sons, 2014), and guest editor of ADClosing the Gap: Information Models in Contemporary Design Practice(Wiley, 2009). Both publications examine the continually expanding capacity of design computing and Building Information Modeling to augment design-side operations, as opposed to simply making them more efficient. This work led to his concept of the architectural workflow and the publication ofWorkflows: Expanding the Territory of Architecture in the Design and Delivery of Buildings(Wiley, 2017). In 2023, Wiley published his new bookBuilding Futures: Technology, Ecology, and Architectural Practice. He holds a Bachelor of Architecture from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and a Master of Science in Advanced Architectural Design from Columbia University’s Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation. He was previously a project manager at SHOP Architects and at Greg Lynn FORM.

This design featured a wine room dug into the rock and encased in concrete at the building’s base.Lake House, Skagit County WAThis Skagit County lakehouse currently completing construction features Shou-Sugi-Ban siding with exposed wood beams and trim. Both the and the ADU garage required extensive foundation work to reclaim the most possible space from the hillside.Belvedere 7, Bellevue WAThis Bellevue hillside home sits on a near 100% slope with concrete piles on the high side and a series of steel posts with X-braces on the low side that elevates the house 40 feet off the ground. A stilted foundation structure like this is common in the Pacific Northwest when building off lakes or mountainous terrain.Lake House, Lake Chelan WALocated along the shores of Lake Chelan, this house just completing construction features an ADU garage unit to maximize living space as a solution to limitations of the lot’s original footprint.Harvey House, Western WALocated in the Cascade mountains, this award-winning home represents the ultimate collaboration between the convictions of the client and the creativity of design. The client had some very specific requests for their home which included “the uncommon use of common materials”, “splendor of the ordinary”, and “a surprise around every corner.”Lake House, Lake Chelan WALocated just above the shoreline of Lake Chelan, this ongoing project faces various design complexities due to soil issues of the hillside with a near 100% slope.Lake House, Lake Chelan WALocated on the shores of Lake Chelan, this family home is just completing construction of its ground up remodel.Western Marine, Seattle WALocated on Harbor Avenue in the industrial buffer zone this 13,000 sf office building attempts to connect to the context of the industrial neighborhood through form and material. The ground floor is parking and storage with 4 levels of tenant office space above with an 800 sf caretakers unit located on the 5th floor.

Three words come to mind about his work ethic: meticulous, conscientious and assiduous. Indeed, design choices were always spot-on, making him invaluable to us as first-time home builders. Sometimes our project seemed so overwhelming, but Gary’s vast experience and industry knowledge was the rock that always kept us in very capable hands!Greg Prigmore, San FranciscoWe met Gary several years ago when considering the purchase of a new home in Eureka Valley. Starting with the initial visit, Gary provided excellent big picture ideas, and subsequently worked with us to transform the house into our dream home. He has provided not only architectural services, but has also served as our “Project Manager,” taking care of the permit process, engineering requirements, bidding and contractor selection, and virtually every detail of the project.

Here, you will be seen, heard, and deeply validated. You will practice vulnerability, cultivate emotional intimacy, and break through the barriers that have kept you stuck.
