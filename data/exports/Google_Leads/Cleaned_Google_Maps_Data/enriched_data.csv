All of our recruiters have over 44 years of combined experience in the legal industry, and most have worked for top law firms. We are very thorough when screening candidates. We get to know the candidate personally so that we can match each attorney with the ideal law firm. We base this on our own vast knowledge of the legal marketplace, as well as the specifications requested by firms and the attorney's own strengths, personalities, style, personality, work ethics, and geographic needs. We ensure that each attorney we work with is fully suited for any law firm they interview with.We Screen Thousands of Attorneys so Chicago Law Firms Don't Have toWe know what it is like to receive resumes for a position within a law firm from countless potential candidates that don't meet the criteria we're looking for. We know how frustrating it can be to have to wade through hundreds of resumes only to find one or two that are acceptable. Therefore, when we screen our attorneys, we make sure they have all of the credentials and characteristics that the firm is looking for. We not only review each candidate's litigation history, billable hours, and academic success, but we also get to know the attorney intimately. We strive to find perfect fits for both attorneys and law firms.Our Recruiters Meet Applicants Face-to-FaceOur recruiters go above and beyond what other recruiters will do. We meet face to face with our attorney candidates and we walk them through each phase of the recruitment process. We have very creative recruiters and they are able to present our attorney candidates to the law firms with confidence. We keep both the attorney and the law firm fully updated throughout each step of the recruitment process. We uphold ourCode of Conductstrictly and maintain confidentiality throughout the entire recruitment process. An attorney's information will never be released to any law firm without approval.Establishing Long-Lasting Relationships with Law FirmsWe not only get to personally know each attorneys that we try to place, but we also take time to get to know each law firm that we work with. We take pride in building long- lasting relationships with the firms. Firms know when we only send them attorney candidates that will be exactly what the firm is looking for. We place our outstanding attorneys with law firms that we believe they will succeed in. Our success is based upon the success of our attorneys and the law firms that we work with, and we take great pride in knowing that we have the expertise to place the right attorney with the best law firm each and every time.Areas of SpecializationAntitrustAntitrust and Trade RegulationBankruptcyConstructionCorporateEmploymentEnergyEnvironmentalERISA/Employee BenefitsFood & Drug AdministrationInternet/E-CommerceIP/Technology TransactionsLitigationProject FinanceReal EstateGovernmentGovernment ContractsGovernment RelationsHealth CareImmigrationInsuranceIntellectual Property - LitigationIntellectual Property - PatentTrademark/CopyrightInternational TradeSecurities LitigationTaxTelecommunicationsTrusts and EstatesWhite Collar CrimeKinds of PlacementsAm Law 100/200Mid-sized Law FirmsPrestigious Boutique Law FirmsSpecialized Smaller Law FirmsContact Us Today!For inquiries in the Midwest, please contact:200 S.

info@masseconomics.com,,,Masseconomics,,"The Baron Building, 620 Massachusetts Ave",https://masseconomics.com/,"Mass EconomicsMass Economics is a research and consulting firm that specializes in urban economic growth and equity. Mass Economics is a technical firm with expertise in data, analytics, surveying, modeling, and strategy, as well as a mission-driven organization committed to inclusive and equitable economic growth. We work with public, private, and philanthropic institutions, and are nationally known for our work on economic cluster strategies, inclusive and equitable growth, urban land issues, and the creation of models that link economic and physical assets.Inclusion and OpportunityThe past 40 years of economic history have made it clear that economic growth alone does not lead to equality – or even to equal opportunity. Our work aims to ensure that the benefits of economic growth span geographies and demographic groups. Our strategies to increase equality and opportunity have included strengthening neighborhood entrepreneurship and local clusters, leveraging infrastructure investments to reimagine opportunities in disinvested areas, helping train local leaders in neighborhood planning, and identifying underutilized land assets for innovative redevelopment in disinvested areas.Urban/Regional Economic StrategiesCities require broad-based strategies to achieve catalytic change. We work closely with our clients and partners to address foundational economic, land use, and inequality challenges. Our staff led the economic development strategy for one of the largest, most transformative urban strategy projects ever undertaken. We have also addressed repositioning cities in the global economy, addressing the skills and spatial mismatches between employers and employees, and revitalizing core city areas to the benefit of neighborhood residents, as well as the city and region.Innovation and EntrepreneurshipIn the past decade, profound economic, demographic, technological and cultural shifts have radically altered the spatial geography of innovation and increasingly, of opportunity. Our most creative institutions, firms, and workers value proximity and integration so that knowledge can be transferred and built upon quickly and seamlessly. Our diverse population demands more and better choices in where they live, work, and play – across building types, neighborhoods, and jurisdictions. And our more open, networked way of life is shifting and accelerating how firms and people interact, how ideas flow, and how places – from research labs to mixeduse developments to neighborhoods – are designed. Mass Economics’ urban innovation projects reimagine cities for the 21st century, whether we are developing measurement and evaluation frameworks for clients, designing new educational models, developing strategies for Innovation Districts, or convening national experts to discuss the opportunities and challenges of innovation-focused economic development.Urban LandMany urban areas face what might be called a land paradox: vast swaths of blight and vacancy but few developable sites, conditions that exacerbate income and opportunity inequality in cities. Mass Economics works with cities on economic development strategies tailored to absorb available land while recognizing the constraints that land assets impose on short-term growth options. We have worked with urban stakeholders on linking land assets and growth clusters, developing industrial growth strategies, rationalizing industrial land holdings, utilizing land assets to spur economic growth in low- and moderate-income areas, and identifying long-term strategies for reuse of vacant land. Our urban land framework explicates the relationship between land challenges and economic opportunity and provides strategies to address land issues.data-Fabdata-Fab is a data system and analytic platform designed to improve our understanding of urban and regional economiesdata-Fab provides high quality employment estimates by detailed industry for counties, MSAs, and custom geographies across the U.S.data-Fab data cover ~1,000 industries in all U.S. counties for three units of times: annually, quarterly, and monthly",Mass Economics is a research and consulting firm that specializes in urban economic growth and equity.

GRO Architects has been based in Lower Manhattan for the past 20 years and recently opened our workshop space, GROworks in Jersey City, servicing projects throughout the metropolitan area.. Our projects range in size, program, and complexity; our design portfolio includes several ground-up multi-family residential projects, the design for religious institutions such as the Montgomery Mosque for the Muslim Federation of New Jersey, and the adaptive reuse of historic structures such as our 125,000sf commercial project for Warren at Bay. Our projects always consider the specific needs of the client and site, responding creatively to constraints to propose innovative design solutions. For example, the Nest Micro-Housing project pushes the boundaries to propose the smallest legal dwelling possible in New Jersey, providing an innovative approach to the accommodation of accessible facilities and flexible built-in furnishings, thereby providing an alternative housing option that addresses the growing housing shortage.GRO recently received the 2022 Honor Award from AIA New Jersey for our Nest Micro-Housing project, completed in 2021. Our urban infill prototype, PREttyFAB, won an AIA Merit Award in 2009, a 2010 PCI Design Award in 2010, and was named “Project of the Year” by the Jersey City Redevelopment Agency that same year. In July 2009, Metropolis Magazine named GRO a “Next Gen Notable” for our Docking Stations project. The scheme envisioned a series of publicly accessible floating extensions from Manhattan into the Hudson and East Rivers that powered city street lamps by harnessing river currents. In 2007, GRO won re:Construction, a design competition curated by the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council and sponsored by the Alliance for Downtown New York, with our project “Best Pedestrian Route”. In 2008, the same project also won an AIA New York Merit Award and a New York Designs Award from the Architectural League of New York. The firm’s design work has been published in the New York Times, the (Newark) Star Ledger, Architectural Record, The Architect’s Newspaper, Fast Company, Azure, Dwell, and Metropolis Magazine.Our firm privileges the integration of emerging technologies to respond to client needs, project complexity, and collaboration between disciplines. As architects, we are intimately engaged in providing creative and sustainable design solutions for a broad array of project types and budgets. The virtual design and construction tools we use to realize our design proposals also allow us to bring to each project a more efficient and optimized construction process. Additionally, these tools have allowed us to operate in a highly efficient manner while maintaining a staff of two licensed architects and seven project designers. Through the conceptualization of how new digital protocols augment, challenge, and change the authorial process of design we create novel opportunities for our practice and bring excellence to design.GRO ARCHITECTS, PLLC is a certified NYC M/WBE.NICOLE ROBERTSONAIA, LEED APNicole Robertson is a partner at the award-winning New York-based firm GRO Architects. Robertson was named one of 32 new faces of design in the December 2010 issue of Dwell magazine. She was the ‘Emerging Architect’ Visiting Assistant Professor at Barnard College in 2007 where she taught design studios and advanced seminars with a focus on digital fabrication technology. Prior to joining the faculty at Barnard, she taught as an Assistant Professor in the School of Architecture at Syracuse University. She has taught graduate representation and introductory design studios in the Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation at Columbia University and graduate representation in the School of Constructed Environments at Parsons the New School for Design. Prior to forming GRO, she worked as a project designer for the Embryological House at Greg Lynn FORM in Los Angeles, and later as a senior designer at Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM) in New York. Robertson holds a Bachelor of Arts from Princeton University and a Master of Architecture from the University of California Los Angeles. Robertson is a LEED Accredited Professional and a licensed Architect in New York and New Jersey.RICHARD GARBERAIARichard Garber, AIA, is a founding partner at GRO Architects and faculty member in the Architecture Department at the University of Pennsylvania’s Weitzman School of Design, where he teaches design studios and seminars. GRO’s work privileges the integration of emerging technologies to respond to client needs, project complexity, and collaboration between disciplines. Richard has written numerous books and essays in which he advocates for technology as it relates to formal speculation, simulation, manufacturing, and building delivery to generate innovate design, assembly, and construction solutions. He is the author ofBIM Design: Realizing the Creative Potential of Building Information Modeling(John Wiley & Sons, 2014), and guest editor of ADClosing the Gap: Information Models in Contemporary Design Practice(Wiley, 2009). Both publications examine the continually expanding capacity of design computing and Building Information Modeling to augment design-side operations, as opposed to simply making them more efficient. This work led to his concept of the architectural workflow and the publication ofWorkflows: Expanding the Territory of Architecture in the Design and Delivery of Buildings(Wiley, 2017). In 2023, Wiley published his new bookBuilding Futures: Technology, Ecology, and Architectural Practice. He holds a Bachelor of Architecture from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and a Master of Science in Advanced Architectural Design from Columbia University’s Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation. He was previously a project manager at SHOP Architects and at Greg Lynn FORM.

Sometimes our project seemed so overwhelming, but Gary’s vast experience and industry knowledge was the rock that always kept us in very capable hands!Greg Prigmore, San FranciscoWe met Gary several years ago when considering the purchase of a new home in Eureka Valley.

I create immersive experiences that allow for true transformation. Through one-on-one counseling, groups, workshops, and retreats, you don’t just process your struggles—you actively engage in the work. In this space, healing is not a theory but a lived experience. Here, you will be seen, heard, and deeply validated. You will practice vulnerability, cultivate emotional intimacy, and break through the barriers that have kept you stuck. Whether you are carrying deep trauma, grief, or unresolved wounds, this journey offers more than coping—it offers freedom. Step into a safe, supportive space where healing isn’t just possible—it’s inevitable."

We understand deeply our clients’ economic, operational, and regulatory challenges. We take these challenges on as our own and meet them by combining beautiful, innovative design with high-quality, efficient, and cost-effective solutions.","Confidential Client Bellevue Office TowerBellevue, WAIn 2020, our client tasked our firm and House of Sorcery with designing an office that would deliver a bold perspective on the changing workplace landscape. This first phase of a tenant improvement for a forty-two-story office tower became a blank canvas for a one-of-a-kind approach to a sense of choice and exploration within the workplace, with development and collaboration taking place over twenty-two months. The heart of the challenge: to provide exceptional spaces that are adaptable to shifting demands and individual preferences. The core and shell concept of a waterfall is echoed in the central concept of the interior project, drawing on the local Pacific Northwest experience. A theme emerged around The Journey—a space where exploration meets preference. This people-first design approach began to sculpt the building, carving out multi-story staircases, social and collaborative zones, quiet focus-oriented areas, and surprising nooks and crannies. Each space is textured by layers of architecture, hand-crafted stories, and moments of wonder. The Journey became a vertical concept—a hiker’s exploration, from base camp to summit, of a mystical waterfall. The entry sequence through reception is verdant, with a hand-painted floor-to-ceiling Electric Coffin mural of local flora and fauna complimented by planted beds. Past reception, […]View Project →Newport Beach Cancer Center RenovationNewport Beach, CaliforniaThis renovation project delivers a new experience for patients undergoing cancer treatment in Newport Beach and the surrounding areas, with a deep focus on providing a truly patient-centered approach. The design team worked closely with staff and user teams to develop an ideal operational flow for the care team and the patient journey, understanding that patients often stay within the facility for multiple hours and sometimes need to see multiple provider types during a single visit. The project includes a second-floor infusion center and pharmacy, grounded by an expansive double-height waiting room and window-lined reception area. The project team paid particular attention in the infusion area to designating flexible spaces for differing levels of social interaction, ensuring patient autonomy in selecting their preferred level of socialization. Central to the infusion area is a space for friends, family, and caregivers to comfortably wait while patients are in treatment. Subtle elements like opacity gradients in glass partitions create a sense of spatial delineation and privacy for patients while maintaining sightlines and access for staff. The focal point of the space is the nearly 180-degree view of the ocean from two intersecting walls that overlook the Pacific. A third-floor medical oncology clinic provides […]View Project →Steadman Philippon Medical BuildingBasalt, COThis three-story, 77,960 s.f. orthopedic center marks the first collaboration between two of Colorado’s major mountain health systems – Vail Health and Aspen Valley Hospital – to bring the world-renowned expertise of The Steadman Clinic and Steadman Philippon Research Institute (SPRI) to the Roaring Fork Valley. With the addition of Howard Head Sports Medicine, the center offers a comprehensive continuum of orthopedic care, capable of serving patients at every step of their diagnostic, surgical, and rehabilitative journey. Situated in the bustling heart of Willits Town Center in Basalt, the new building sits on a sprawling lot with a connected park, emphasizing the indoor/outdoor connection so integral to the region. The building’s exterior, constructed primarily of brick and stone, features a sweeping glazed corner entrance that welcomes patients inside from the town’s main thoroughfare and glows like a lantern when the sun slips behind the surrounding mountains. The building’s first floor houses a ground-level parking garage, which extends one level below grade; an entry lounge, market, and 3T MRI suite round out the first-floor programming.

Home page.","Design PhilosophyAuthentic(‘au then tic’) 1. of undisputed origin; genuine. 2. representing one’s true nature or beliefs.My ambition as an architect is to connect building to place.  I study the climate, landscape, and history of the Rocky Mountain region for design inspiration. For me, authenticity is found when a building emerges so strongly from its place that you can no longer imagine it anywhere else.I strive for clarity in planning by placing simple forms in a direct relationship with their habitat. I take a rigorous approach to design and believe that floor plans should be concise and efficient. I create a maximum experience with a minimum footprint.I am drawn to basic, unpretentious materials that weather naturally with time. I look to local vernacular architecture for material and form inspiration. I often expose the structural framework in my designs, giving clarity to the architectural statement.I strive to create an architecture of authenticity."

I understand it's difficult and challenging to find the right person to work with. Hello, I'm Christy Maxey and I've worked with thousands of people just like you and me and I know a thing or two about how to help people. What I found is that we all suffer at times in our lives, and we suffer over common themes, and NOBODY TEACHES US WHAT TO DO WITH OUR EMOTIONS, OUR THOUGHTS & OUR RELATIONSHIPS . That's where I come in. I'm a former therapist, now personal development life coach & author of The Maxx Method: How to Love Yourself and The Mindful Dating Journal , available on Amazon. I use an effective , efficient system of evidenced-based concepts, tools and exercises and I will help you go deep, uncover true self-worth, develop emotional intelligence and provide life-long skills that will help guide you in the relationship with yourself, with others and in your life. Remember, you are not broken. There is nothing wrong with you. And , it doesn't have to take years of therapy to figure it out. Let's get started!","Our time spent together will be getting to the root of what we are working on. How are you holding yourself back? What limiting beliefs do you have? What are you resisting or how is self-doubt and judgment keeping you stuck? How is your past STILL affecting you NOW? Where is the anxiety and stress coming from? Most times, we just don't know. Most therapists and coaches will work all over the map, allow you to talk about your week and you will see little to no results. We get right to the issues and I won't waste your time."

helps professionals and entrepreneurs master presentation, public speaking 
and business communication skills. Offices in Walnut Creek, California and 
Brooklyn, New York.","TestimonialsChad Rountree, Chief Executive Officer, Propel AmericaTihanna’s coaching services came highly recommended to me by my wife.  As a newly appointed CEO at the time, I recognized the importance of understanding my influence on my team and the broader organization. I was also seeking support to strengthen my confidence in being the organization's chief storyteller (both internally and externally). That’s why I believed working with Tihanna would be valuable.When Tihanna and I first began our sessions, the two significant challenges I faced were understanding the underlying perspectives that shaped my leadership and overcoming a lack of self-confidence that led me to over-prepare for external engagements, be it fundraising efforts, panel discussions, or high-stakes partnership meetings.Tihanna's Energy Leadership process was a game-changer for me. Through her guidance, I was able to delve into the beliefs and mindsets that influenced my actions and decisions. Her approach, combined with invaluable feedback from peers and introspective assessments, provided clarity on my leadership style and its impact.Tihanna introduced me to leadership and speaking frameworks with hands-on practices that boosted my confidence, especially in high-stakes situations. Her insights into communication overall were particularly enlightening. With her expertise, I not only have become more self-aware but I have also learned to harness my strengths and address my weaknesses effectively.Working with Tihanna has been a pivotal experience. Her guidance and strategies have empowered me to lead with greater confidence and clarity. I am deeply appreciative of her unwavering support and expertise.Crystal Rountree, Chief Revenue & Development Officer, Teach for AmericaTihanna is a captivating communicator and masterful coach. I appreciated how she infused storytelling and reflective questioning throughout our conversation, and created space for me to pause and capture my thoughts along the way.I found our coaching conversation extremely helpful, reflective, and inspiring - I even cleared an additional two hours after our allotted time to continue the conversation.I'm looking forward to our follow-up call for my Energy Leadership Index assessment and to more coaching engagements with her in the future!Lindsay Kelly, VP, Media Relations Director of Brand and Communications, Vela Education FundTihanna is an exceptional communicator, coach, and human. Her people-first approach allows her to deeply understand the untapped strengths of individuals and the places where there are mental blockages that need to be loosened.She is extremely talented at fostering safe, fun, engaging, and energizing communities and trainings where people feel comfortable working through their individual and collective challenges to strengthen their communications skills. Her ability to see the full picture at an organization - from the senior leaders to the practitioners on the ground - allows her to advise her trainees on a macro and micro level to ensure full alignment with the organization's goals and values.Tihanna did a tremendous job building a meaningful relationship with my organization's CEO and helping her dramatically improve her communication skills for both internal and external audiences. She also equipped our regional senior leaders and our communications team with the tools and support to take our media relations work to the next level.She was a thoughtful partner in all of this work and I highly recommend her to any company or organization looking to strengthen the communications capabilities of their team.Carrie Fryzol, Director of Finance for Edmonson ElectricMy goals when I first decided to meet with Tihanna almost a year ago were simply to improve my public speaking skills. Since then, our coaching sessions have evolved with a broader focus on my spiritual and mental growth.Through our work together, Tihanna has opened up a deeper understanding of where I need to focus and grow in order to be the best version of myself. Because of her attentiveness and her ability to ask the difficult questions and get to the heart of the matter, she's pushed me to continually improve myself.Tihanna's coaching style, authenticity and passion for what she does is a gift to those that she works with. She has been instrumental in my professional and personal development.Jie Davis, Financial Operations Analyst, IlluminaI'm so happy my 1st public speech training was with Tihanna. She made me realize that I'm not bad at public speaking, as a matter of fact, I might be good at it :)Tihanna taught me alot about being ourselves and letting go of negative interpretations - it was an eye opener for me. I stopped thinking of my audiences as “VP” or “Chief Officers”, and more about looking at them as a person who wants to understand my content and can be helped by it which has helped to reduce my nervousness.Karen Williams, Creative Art Director, MasterClassI was completely blown away by all the amazing frameworks and practical steps I took from my sessions with Tihanna. The most surprising and insightful piece of wisdom that came from Tihanna was this statement about public speaking: “it’s not a speaking problem but a thinking problem.” Mind Blown!At the end of the day, I can gain all the tools and practice non stop, but if I don’t reframe my negative inner thoughts and own my true voice, I won’t be successful in my pursuit to becoming a great speaker.I have gained so much inspiration, insight, and wisdom from my work with Tihanna and her vast array of experience in communication. I recommend her for anyone looking to own their voice.Taylor Hesselgrave, Senior UI Engineer, NetflixI booked several sessions with Tihanna when I was interviewing for a new job. We worked together on how to answer the ubiquitous, ""Tell me about yourself"" question, and I brought a couple others I thought I might be asked frequently as well.Tihanna helped me refine my answers down into succinct, focused and personable stories highlighting my potential. She also helped me with subtle body language cues and professional presentation (remote in my case).I got so much value practicing and preparing for interviewing with Tihanna.  In the end, I was asked these questions several times and I was READY! I felt confident about my answers and my delivery, and the way she prepared me kept me from sounding stiff or too rehearsed.I received positive feedback from all of my interviewers about my composure and ""excellent communication skills"", and received the best offer of my life so far. Thank you Tihanna!"

My girls were no longer babies and I didn't want to continue defining myself as a mother and only a mother. I love being a mom, but I needed something outside of motherhood to fulfill me, and I struggled knowing what to do about that.Through her book, podcast, and social media content Meghan helped me look at the ""story"" I was telling myself - how I wasn't good enough, smart enough, capable enough - and she helped me call out all that BS and helped me find the confidence to write a new story. I always love how she makes you look at what is no longer working for you. She is always reminding you to look within and reminding you that YOU ARE EXACTLY WHERE YOU NEED TO BE. (That one is my favorite.)Super grateful that Meghan is out there, helping people change the way they look at things, and helping people create approaches that align with who they are.

mmalloy@ewp-financial.com,,,Ewp Financial,+1 530 692 1007,40 Wall St 28th floor,https://www.ewp-financial.com/,"“I have had the pleasure to meet Mr. Michael Malloy through family relations. Though we have not had any business relations as such, we have had a number of conversations about his professional activities because of my own interest, as in Germany, his field of expertise in international finance falls under the jurisdiction of my Senate.Based on these conversations, I have a firm impression that Mr. Malloy is a wise and knowledgeable man of great integrity. He does not measure his professional success by his own short-term business expectations, but much more so in the economic interests of his clients. He has a profound knowledge of economic relationships, including their international ramifications, as well as a keen sense of possible future developments. Together, these two aspects enable him to have a highly accurate analysis of complex economic situations. This in turn lets him carefully weigh the opportunities and risks of various investment strategies. Additionally, Mr. Malloy has a clear view of tax and legal implications, and knows when and how to call in further expert professional advice in this area. On the basis of this, I feel I can highly recommend Mr. Michael Malloy’s professional services. The above is not subject to my liability as per the German Civil Code (see section 675 paragraph 2 of the German Civil Code.). I have given this statement to the best of my knowledge and belief.”~ Ulrich Herrman Presiding Justice of the Federal Supreme Court, Germany ~","Welcome to EWP Financial, your best source for Expanded Worldwide Planning/International Tax Planning & Private Placement Life Insurance."

She helped me gain critical thinking skills that helped me put together a 5 year strategy that has paved the way to my success. She has a way of making me look at things from so many different perspectives which has helped me relate better to my clients. I’m a hair stylist so I don’t have the type of business that most people think of when they think of Executive Coaching, but I am a business owner and when I started thinking like one, my business went through the roof.Kristy DiSabatoBrazilian Blowdry Boutique"
