christie@christiedenson.com,,,,(612) 421-2205,2042 Wooddale Dr suite 250,https://christiedenson.com/,"Is Paid UGC a the same as Paid Testimonial? Paid user-generated content (UGC) video and paid testimonials might seem similar at first glance since both involve compensation for content creation. However, they serve different purposes and convey distinct types of authenticity and audience engagement. Here’s how they differ: Paid UGC Video for Brand Use Authentic Creative Expression: Even when paid UGC videos are intended for use on a brand's site, they're created to capture genuine experiences or creative interpretations involving the product or service. This content is often more relatable and engaging than traditional marketing materials. Flexibility and Diversity: These videos allow for a broader range of content types and storytelling angles. This approach enriches your brand’s digital marketing with varied, authentic voices and experiences, showcasing the brand through the eyes of its users. Enhancing Brand Authenticity: By featuring paid UGC on their site, brands can enhance the perception of authenticity and trust among visitors. This content serves as proof of real engagement and satisfaction with the product, beyond traditional marketing claims. Paid Testimonial Structured Endorsement: In contrast, paid testimonials on a brand's site are more straightforward endorsements. The content is usually more focused and controlled, with the aim of highlighting specific benefits or positive experiences with the product or service. Consistent Messaging: Testimonials are crafted to align closely with the brand’s messaging, offering a polished and consistent endorsement. This format relies on the credibility and relatability of the person giving the testimonial to influence potential customers.","According to Adweek, UGC results in a 29% higher web conversion rate than campaigns or websites without it. For local businesses, this means that incorporating UGC can significantly boost online sales or in-store visits by providing relatable and persuasive content."

Either way, we have you covered. Your employee benefit plan can be the difference between satisfied and dissatisfied employees. Your employee benefit plan can also be the difference between realizing and not realizing cost savings for your company. Regardless of your opinion on the most effective employee benefit plans, everyone can agree employee benefit plan regulations can become confusing due to the different requirements at the state, local, and federal levels. The most common employee benefit plans include health insurance, retirement plans, life insurance, and disability insurance. However, as a small business, you may find yourself competing with the never-ending benefits of larger employers who may offer tuition reimbursement or even pet insurance. At Odoni Partners LLC, we have the expertise to audit your employee benefit plan from top-down to ensure that you are providing your employees with a robust employee benefits plan, at a cost that is not detrimental to your overall business model.403b and 401k Audit RequirementsWe are also knowledgeable about upcoming changes and regulations put in place by the Department of Labor. We stay up to date on all employee benefit regulations and rules, so that your business can focus on its core competencies, rather than reading about complex benefit plan changes. If you decide that you’d like to audit your employee benefit plan, we will communicate with you about it every step of the way. We will create a plan for the audit, and make sure that you are aware of the milestones. We will also communicate the requirements of your audit plan in an easy-to-understand way so that your business is not bogged down by technical jargon. You will walk away from our audit with a clear understanding of what is and isn’t part of your employee benefit plan regulations, and we can also create a strategy for the future based on upcoming regulations. We will also communicate and work with stakeholders in employee benefit plans (because of course, an employee benefit plan often involves outside record-keepers, insurance companies, and other stakeholders) to make sure everyone stays in the loop throughout the audit.Retirement Plan AuditsOur vast experience includes:-Defined contribution (401(k),403(b), profit-sharing,ESOP: A defined contribution plan means that the employee contributes to the plan (or both the employer and the employee). We can help audit defined contribution plans to make sure they are compliant.-Defined benefit pension (pension, cash balance): A defined benefit plan requires the employer to contribute to the pension plan. The regulations around pension plans often change, so it is advised to consult an expert.-Union-represented plans: Employees who are represented by bargaining unions may also have a union-represented plan. This may require negotiations on the part of the employer and union. Union-represented plan regulations can also change fairly often.-Health and Welfare: We can advise you on health and welfare plans for your employees, and what documents are needed to maintain compliance.-Master Trusts: A master trust is an investment tool that utilizes pooled investments. Companies can also pool assets with other companies regarding master trust benefits. These benefits can become highly complex, but we are prepared to guide your business in master trusts.-SEC 11-K Filings: The U.S Securities and Exchange Commission requires filings for employee stock plans offered by employers. There are strict deadlines and regulations to follow when filing.-Full-scope/Limited Scope: Unlike a full scope audit, during a limited scope audit, auditors are unable to express their opinions. At Odoni Partners LLC, we can conduct both full and limited scope audits.-Form 5500 and Form 990 filings: Although you may be a tax-exempt organization, you are still required to file to remain compliant. We can advise you on which forms to file as a tax-exempt organization.401k Plan Audit ReportProspective and current employees will judge your company’s viability based on the benefits plans offered. Therefore, it is in your best interest to conduct a full audit to make sure you are in compliance and offering the benefit plan that best suits your business needs. At Odoni Partners LLC, we are happy to guide you through the employee benefits process, and help you create strong internal controls to ensure your plans are compliant with local, state, and federal regulations. Contact us to learn how we can help you create compliant plans and monitor employee benefits compliance. There are ever-changing regulations around employee benefit plans, and they can be hard to decipher. We can assist you in understanding how to remain compliant in employee benefit plans.ERISA 401k Audits ChicagoComprehensive ERISA 401(k) Audit Services in Chicago, ILNavigating the complexities of ERISA 401(k) compliance can be daunting.

Students, graduates, and faculty had no online access to Dossier resources. The original workflow of the office included a labor intensive, paper based process. The need for accuracy and timeliness was great, and the workload became extremely high during the few months when graduate students typically apply for academic positions.RequirementsHarvard OCS engaged Nevo to:Redesign the Dossier Management process to streamline the dossier production effort, reduce the file space that filled an entire large room with wall-to-wall file cabinets, significantly reduce the turnaround time for dossier production and mailing, and to give the Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS) greater control over the creation and distribution of their personal dossiers
                    Create a software solution that would be easy to manage, user friendly, and would reduce the administrative effort needed to track dossier materials so that more time could be spent advising graduate students on making good choices in their applications for academic positions
                    Create the means for FAS graduate students and faculty to manage more effectively their dossier materials, and to reduce the large number of phone calls requesting information on whether a letter of reference had arrived at OCS yet
                    Enable easy administration and the periodic measurement of the success of the programNevo's SolutionNevo first redesigned Harvard's dossier process to eliminate more than half the steps involved in creating and sending a dossier, and at the same time freeing up the dossier storage room by creating a database of scanned copies of original letters and an offsite archive strategy that simplified and eliminated most of the need to handle original letters of recommendation in the course of day to day business.Nevo designed a self-service web-based solution for use by Harvard's graduate students and faculty, enabling them to specify and request dossiers 24x7, with the expectation that their completed dossier would be in the mail to its destination the same or the following day, reducing a 3-5 day turnaround time to less than 24 hours. Users can track the arrival of their letters of recommendation online, and can readily manage their own information independently, on their own schedule.Nevo further developed a powerful administrative interface that enables the director of the dossier service to assist students and faculty in the use of the system, to perform a wide variety of system administration tasks, and to periodically measure the success of the program using a flexible query and reporting system.Architecturally, the OCS Dossier System is a multi-tiered Java-based web application, utilizing an XML/XSLT-based presentation layer. The print component is a Windows Service that detects when dossiers are available for printing, composes the dossiers into a composite PDF file, and adds them to a printer queue. We implemented over an Oracle database, and recommended a high-speed scanner / printer from Xerox for production of the high volume of dossiers that occurs seasonally.The system was delivered on time and on budget, has been in production since June 2002 and is currently in use by Harvard graduate students, faculty, and OCS. As a result of the close collaboration between Nevo and Harvard's Office of Career Services, feedback on the new Dossier System has been extremely positive. The OCS workload is dramatically reduced, the quality of the printed dossiers is improved, clients of the system are very happy to be in control of their own dossiers, and the large dossier file room has been allocated to other uses.Close","A High Performance Software Team is remarkably similar to a winning sports team.

info@westtoeastllc.com,,,,(602) 821-7516,2375 E Camelback Rd Suite 600 #153,https://westtoeastllc.com/,"By leveraging the benefits of a fractional CFO, businesses can effectively manage their financial operations, gain valuable insights, and position themselves for long-term success without the significant overhead costs associated with a full-time CFO. This strategic approach can be particularly advantageous for companies in growth stages or those seeking to optimize their financial performance. Hiring a fractional CFO can provide numerous benefits for businesses, especially those that may not require a full-time chief financial officer or are in a growth phase. Here are some key advantages: >> Cost Savings Compared to a Full-Time CFO : One of the primary benefits of hiring a fractional CFO is the cost savings compared to employing a full-time CFO. Fractional CFOs work on a part-time or project basis, allowing businesses to access high-level financial expertise without the overhead costs associated with a full-time executive-level position. >>Access to Experienced Financial Expertise : Fractional CFOs bring extensive experience and expertise in financial management, strategic planning, and operational optimization. They have typically worked with multiple companies across various industries, providing them with a diverse set of skills and best practices. This wealth of knowledge can be invaluable for businesses seeking to improve their financial processes, implement effective controls, and make informed strategic decisions. >>Objectivity and Fresh Perspective : As an outsider to the organization, a fractional CFO can provide an objective and unbiased perspective on financial matters. They are not bound by internal politics or long-standing practices, allowing them to identify inefficiencies, challenge assumptions, and propose innovative solutions. This fresh perspective can be instrumental in driving positive change and fostering a culture of continuous improvement within the organization. >>Scalability : Fractional CFOs offer a scalable solution for businesses with fluctuating financial needs. As the company grows or faces new challenges, the fractional CFO's involvement can be adjusted accordingly.

Whether you need to reorganize how your team works together, find new team members to enhance performance and productivity, or need to add an entire operations team to your company, Clarke can provide those services.The Clarke Business Services Team reviews each company’s Client Discovery Questionnaire to determine the best Business Strategy Consultant to work with your company based on industry and client needs.

🔵 MY STORY

In 2009, I embarked on a transformative journey by participating in the CAS “Women Back to Business” program at the University of St. Gallen. This experience led to my involvement in a study on Social Media and Employer Branding for Schindler Management Ltd., which inspired me to establish Blueinthemiddle GmbH in 2011. Since then, I’ve successfully supported numerous SMEs in developing and executing their social media marketing strategies. In 2017, I further enhanced my expertise by completing the CAS “Digital Marketing Specialist” at FHNW.

👩🏽🎓 MY BACKGROUND

I hold a Master’s degree in Business Administration and Economics, with a professional background in SAP and Business Intelligence. My diverse experience spans various roles, including a part-time consulting position at 2BCS AG, and extensive work at IMG AG, a spin-off of the University of St. Gallen..

Co-Author of Build Trust. Builder & Developer Magazine’s Who's Who in Homebuilding!Los Angeles Metropolitan Area5.0(19 reviews)Overall rating of 5 based on 19 reviewsI'm a featured keynote speaker, co-author of the national best seller Build Trust, and a leadership, peak performance, sales and employee development coach. I've been speaking and coaching full time since 1992. My keynotes, workshops and coaching sessions, whether in person or online, inspire, enlighten and empower people to help them develop, unlock, and unleash their extraordinary best self to produce sustainable growth and make consistent personal progress!

My leadership, sales and employee development programs feature my Moore’s Law of Achievement and Moore’s Path to Peak Performance that enable my clients to attract, hire, retain and develop people who become extraordinary.

I am a lifelong learner with over 40 years’ experience in Leadership, Coaching, Sales Training and Employee Development, I created Moore Leadership & Peak Performance which includes workshops and coaching sessions that address the specific challenges faced by everyone in the Homebuilding, Building Supply, Floor Covering, Design Center and Retail Industries.

My Making Customers Series sets a new standard for sales education and development and leads to the healing of the dysfunctional buyer and seller relationship to produce sustainable sales growth.

My New Home Retailing and Finished Home Design workshops for Homebuilder Sales Leaders, New Home Salespeople and New Home Interior Designers and Design Center Management helps them understand the difference between 'new' homebuyers and 'used' homebuyers to produce increased sales and improve both the homebuying and homeownership experience.

I’m considered a futurist, as I began speaking about the internet, technology, artificial intelligence, the 'New Economy' and devices that would deliver our communication, information and entertainment in 1994. In 1996, I co-founded Options Online, a National Award-Winning Online Design Studio and Personalization Operating System for the Homebuilding Industry. Its success is unparalleled as it has now processed over 4.8 Billion Dollars in new homebuyer personalization, options and upgrade selections.

I am also recognized by Builder & Developer Magazine in their 'Who’s Who in Homebuilding' and in May 2018 Klout rated me in the top 1% on Leadership, Peak Performance and Sales and July 2019 Twitter ranked me #1 in Leadership, Sales Training, Leadership Development, Employee Development, Peak Performance and Homebuilding.

hello@greenkeyllc.com,,,,888-368-5336,136 Madison Ave,http://www.greenkeyllc.com/,"Welcome back to #WeAreGreenKey, where we shine a spotlight on our powerhouse corporate teams.Recently, we had the opportunity to meet withNatalie DiDesidero, Senior Recruiter on ourTalent Acquisitionteam at Green Key. With over 14 years of experience in talent acquisition, Natalie has seen the industry evolve and understands what it takes to find and place top candidates in an ever-changing job market. Her deep knowledge of recruiting strategies, relationship-building, and talent development makes her a valuable addition to our team.In this feature, we’ll dive into her career journey, what brought her to Green Key, and her vision for the future.Can you tell us a little about your background and what led you to a career in talent acquisition?Talent Acquisition and Corporate recruiting are about more than just finding the right candidate for a role – they are about shaping the future of an organization and creating meaningful opportunities for individuals.  My journey into recruiting began in 2007, when I was looking for a career that combined my competitive drive with my ability to connect with people.  I quickly realized that recruiting was not just about filling positions, but about understanding a company’s culture, identifying talent that aligns with its goals, and fostering lasting professional relationships.  With that said, in 2010 I found myself interviewing for a talent acquisition role because I wanted to share with others a company that I believed in.What are some of the biggest lessons you’ve learned throughout your career?Throughout my recruiting career, I’ve gained valuable insights that have shaped my approach.  One the most important lessons is that listening is far more powerful than speaking.  Recruiting isn’t just about reviewing resumes, it’s about building meaningful relationships.  By understanding a candidate’s motivations and career aspirations, I can gain their trust and help guide them towards opportunities that truly align with their skills and goals, ensuring a strong hiring decision.  Another key lesson is that cultural fit is just as important as technical skills.  While many people can recruit candidates, a successful hire requires alignment with company values and workplace culture.  If a candidate’s mindset and principles don’t complement the organization, even the most impressive qualifications won’t lead to long term success.  Lastly, employer branding plays a critical role in attracting top talent – not just for the company, but the recruiter as well.  High-quality candidates seek out organizations with strong legacies and positive reputations.  As a recruiter, we can help shape and promote that image, ensuring that our outreach resonates with the right individuals and strengthens the company’s brand overall.What attracted you to this opportunity, and what excites you most about joining the team?When I first considered Green Key Resources, the familiarity and trust of former connections – particularly Rich Egloff – gave me a strong sense of confidence in exploring the opportunity.  It felt reassuring to know that people from my former employer had taken the leap from another agency to Green Key.  As soon as I had my initial conversation, I was drawn to Green Key’s dynamic and strategic approach to recruiting.  The leadership style resonated with me, and I could see the significant transformation happening within the Talent Acquisition team – and this is something that I wanted to be a part of – building a department to be stronger than the way I joined it.  Visiting the team in NYC solidified my enthusiasm.  Seeing firsthand the depth of expertise, tenure, and market reputation within Green Key was inspiring.  The experience, the diverse professionals, and the company’s commitment to both business growth and valuing its people made it clear – this was a place where I could thrive and contribute.How has your experience prepared you for this senior recruiter role?Throughout my career in TA, I have developed the skills, insights, and mindset to thrive in a senior role.  I have managed people and helped them develop their skills, along with developing mine.  My ability to identify and attract top talent stems from years of experience in sourcing, relationship-building, and aligning candidates with business needs.  In the past, I have managed everything from talent pipeline development, creation and execution of business strategies to the full cycle recruitment process.  I understand business trends, employer branding, and workforce planning to ensure organizational success.  That said, I have strengthened my ability to be a trusted advisor to both our internal hiring managers and candidates interested in making career changes.  I am eager to leverage my recruiting knowledge, leadership skills, and vision to drive meaningful outcomes and create high-performing teams.What are your key priorities in your new role?As I step into this role at Green Key, my primary focus has been on understanding the business landscape and hiring needs. Over the past few weeks, I have dived into learning about the company’s goals, hiring challenges, and the unique preferences of hiring managers. Building strong relationships with key stakeholders and organizational leaders has been a priority, ensuring seamless collaboration in securing top talent.Additionally, I am committed to creating a positive candidate experience and strengthening the employer brand, making Green Key an attractive company for top talent.  By leveraging my established network and prior partnerships, I aim to engage talent who may be open to new opportunities. Sharing my firsthand experiences with Green Key allows me to authentically showcase the organization’s strengths, fostering trust and interest among potential candidates.What trends are you seeing in talent acquisition, and how do you plan to leverage them?Companies have shifted their focus from traditional qualifications to behavior-based interviewing, emphasizing the importance of identifying and addressing skill gaps within teams.  My goal is to pinpoint the competencies that our team may be missing and strategically build a talent pipeline to strengthen those areas.  A growing trend in talent acquisition is upskilling – organizations are actively investing in employee development and learning opportunities to maintain their workforce.  Looking ahead, I hope to contribute to this effort from the TA perspective, ensuring alignment with leadership and streamlining the hiring process for greater efficiency and effectiveness with our time.  Lastly, I’ve expressed my passion for employer branding and am actively collaborating with our marketing team to enhance recruitment materials.  By developing engaging content – such as polished job descriptions and marketing collateral – we can provide candidates with valuable insights as they explore opportunities with GKR.What advice would you give to someone looking to grow in their recruiting career?Building a successful career in recruiting requires strategic thinking, relationship-building, and continuous learning.  At its core, recruiting is about people – not just the process.  Investing time in meaningful connections, actively listening, and understanding candidates beyond just their resume are keys to long term placements.  In today’s evolving market, recruiters must constantly refine their approach, particularly with AI reshaping hiring practices.  Staying adaptable, exploring creative sourcing strategies, and sharpening communication skills will set strong recruiters apart.  Equally important is maintaining a selfless mindset – prioritizing the needs of candidates and clients to foster trust and long-lasting relationships. Personal branding plays a vital role in career growth, positioning yourself as a thought leader enhances credibility and creates opportunity within the industry.What keeps you motivated and passionate about talent acquisition?Talent acquisition excites me because it’s more than just filling roles – it’s about shaping careers, making connections, and strengthening an organization. I have watched countless people put their trust in me and take a position with my organization, which has had life-changing impacts on them and their family.  I have witnessed talent that I helped hire get promoted in the organization and be able to buy their first house, which is incredibly fulfilling to me.  Over the past 18 years in the industry, I’ve had the privilege of connecting with hundreds of incredible professionals, many of whom I keep in touch with today.  I remain committed to championing their success, supporting their journeys, and fostering relationships beyond the workplace.Outside of work, what do you enjoy doing in your free time?In my free time, I love spending time with my husband, our three kids, our dog, and extended family.  The grass doesn’t grow under our feet, as our lives are filled with sports and activities that bring excitement and energy.  I find joy reliving my youth through my children’s experiences.  As a multi-sport coach, I dedicate my time to guiding and encouraging them – developing both on and off the field/court.  When I do have a little extra free time, you’ll most likely find me soaking up the sun on a beach somewhere.Read Continue","Accounting + Finance Healthcare + Life Sciences Information Technology Professional Services Financial Services Human Resources Legal Support Architecture, Engineering & Construction Marketing & Sales"

PayNW specializes in serving organizations that are navigating growth, complexity, or transitions in their payroll and HR systems. These clients benefit most from PayNW’s high-touch support, robust features, and scalable platform. Organizations with 50+ Employees: • Businesses of this size often face new challenges, such as meeting ACA (Affordable Care Act) requirements, managing growing headcounts, and handling increasingly complex payroll and HR needs. • PayNW’s solutions are designed to reduce the strain on lean HR teams by streamlining processes that might otherwise require additional headcount. • Clients also benefit from tailored support that evolves as their organizations grow, ensuring the system remains an effective solution over time. Businesses with Fewer than 50 Employees: • Small businesses (under 50 employees) also benefit from the same personalized, scalable service. A key consideration for businesses under 50 is ensuring that someone, often not the owner, handles payroll.
