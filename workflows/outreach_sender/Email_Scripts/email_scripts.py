cold_email_prompt_template = """
### Company Info:
- Name: {company_name}
- Industry: {industry_info}
- Offer Summary: {offer_summary}

### Your Task:
Write a short, warm cold outreach email (under 120 words) to the company above.

### Script Rules:
1. Do NOT summarize what the company does. Instead, use their offer to show deep understanding and context.
2. Mention our company ‚Äî Outbound Accelerator ‚Äî as specialists in advanced AI workflows.
3. Say: "We help companies like yours ‚Äî companies that {offer_summary.lower()} ‚Äî streamline complex operations and drive results."
4. Mention tailored-specific results: reduce manual tasks, eliminate inefficiencies, and increase booked calls by 2‚Äì3x. (This will not be in the email, but is for your context.)
5. Also include 1‚Äì2 of these 2025-relevant benefits of AI:
   - Smarter, faster decisions
   - Scaling without hiring
   - Personalized experiences
   - Automated compliance/risk tracking
   - Refocusing team on high-value work
6. Also highlight 1‚Äì2 common pain points solved:
   - Human error from messy workflows
   - Tool overload / siloed systems
   - Workload overload (e.g., 1 person juggling 50+ clients)
   - No automation or optimization support
   - Old systems blocking full-funnel automation
7. Be specific with industry context: instead of ‚Äúbusinesses like yours,‚Äù say ‚Äúother {industry_info.lower()} businesses.‚Äù
8. Close by naming a likely pain (complexity, error, etc.) and why a tailored workflow would help.
9. End the email inviting them to watch a short video breakdown showing how our system works and how it applies to them.
10. Final sentence must include our company name: Outbound Accelerator.
11. This email must be short, warm, and human-sounding. Avoid sounding generic or robotic. 

### Example Output (for style/tone only):
"At Outbound Accelerator, we help online learning companies reduce backend tasks and book more calls with AI-powered workflows tailored to their process."

### Output Format:
- Keep it casual, friendly, human-sounding
- No emojis, fake flattery, square brackets, or robotic tone
