Rewrite the subject to lightly personalize it for the specific lead using the provided data.

You are given JSON with:
- base_subject: the current generic subject
- company_name: e.g., "Acme Roofing"
- offer_summary: e.g., "roof replacement & storm repair"
- overview/custom_1: optional context

Instructions:
- Where sensible, weave the company_name or a crisp, relevant term from the offer_summary into the base_subject.
- Keep it natural, short, and relevant to workflow/ops improvement.
- Prefer clarity over cleverness; avoid vague or forced phrasing.
- Do not awkwardly say “we specialize in helping {{company}}”; instead, phrase as “ideas to improve {{company}}’s ops” or “ways to enhance {{company}} workflow”.
- If no reliable specific details exist, keep it generic.

Constraints:
- Max 6–8 words.
- No emojis, brackets, clickbait, or spam triggers.
- Do not add RE:, FWD:, or punctuation spam.

Deliverability rules:
- Avoid spam-trigger words: free, discount, guaranteed, guarantee, bonus, sale, special offer, no obligation, risk-free, click here, instant, act now, urgent, limited time, last chance, hurry, exclusive offer, priority, final hours, winner, prize, deal, cash, earn, easy money, get rich quick, credit, debt, refinance, investment, miracle, secret, scientifically proven, weight loss, congratulations, offer expires, apply now, order now, call now.
- Do not use RE:, FWD:, ALL CAPS, excessive punctuation (!!!), emojis, or brackets [] {} <>.
