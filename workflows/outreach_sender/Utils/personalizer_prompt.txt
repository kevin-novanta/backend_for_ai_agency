<file name=1 path=/Users/kevinnovanta/backend_for_ai_agency/workflows/outreach_sender/Utils/personalizer_prompt.txt>Rewrite the base opener email to be specifically tailored to the company named {{company_name}} using the offer described in {{offer_summary}}.

Note that base_subject and base_body_html may already contain industry-specific language replacing generic phrases; preserve these specific terms and refine them if needed.

Do not revert to generic terms if a specific reference is available.

Replace any remaining generic phrases like "we help businesses automate" with precise, industry-specific language that reflects the offer, for example, "Outbound Accelerator is a company that [core description] and could potentially help {{company_name}} by {{offer_summary}}."

Keep the same call-to-action as the original base email.

Format the email so each sentence is followed by a blank line, mimicking a normal email structure.

Maintain a short, casual, and direct tone throughout the email.

Ensure the total word count does not exceed 110 words.

Do not include any placeholders, brackets, or generic filler text in the final output.

Return ONLY a JSON object with exactly two keys: "subject" and "body_html".

Use {{company_name}} and {{offer_summary}} as placeholders where the script will insert actual lead data.

\nExclude terms & patterns (deliverability):
- Avoid spam-trigger words and constructions in subject or body: free, discount, guaranteed, guarantee, bonus, sale, special offer, no obligation, risk-free, click here, instant, act now, urgent, limited time, last chance, hurry, exclusive offer, priority, final hours, winner, prize, deal, cash, earn, easy money, get rich quick, credit, debt, refinance, investment, miracle, secret, scientifically proven, weight loss, congratulations, offer expires, apply now, order now, call now.
- Do not use RE:, FWD:, ALL CAPS, excessive punctuation (!!!), emojis, or brackets [] {} <>.</file>
Personalize the base opener email for this lead.

Inputs you will receive (as JSON in the next message):
- base_subject, base_body_html
- company_name (may be empty)
- offer_summary (messy, first-person, or marketing-ish text is possible)
- offer_hint (a short neutral hint derived from offer_summary)
- overview, custom_1 (optional context)

Formatting:
- End EVERY sentence with a period, then a line break, then a BLANK LINE (i.e., "\n\n").
- Keep total under 110 words.
- Tone: warm, plain, confident; zero hype.
- Mention "Outbound Accelerator" exactly once in the body.

Personalization rules:
- Use the company name naturally. Avoid awkward phrasing like “we specialize in helping {{company_name}}…”. Prefer: “Outbound Accelerator builds AI workflow infrastructure and could help companies like {{company_name}} …”.
- Treat {{offer_summary}} ONLY as context. DO NOT copy it verbatim. Rephrase it into one short, clean benefit that connects their focus to how our AI workflows help (e.g., automate onboarding, reduce busywork, speed handoffs, surface insights, cut costs). If {{offer_hint}} is present, use it to guide that benefit.
- If {{offer_summary}} is messy or first‑person (“we love doing…”, “we specialize in…”), summarize the substance and drop the fluff.
- Do not write "{{company_name}} like yours"; if you need that construction, use "companies like yours" instead.
- Preserve and refine any specific industry/offer language already present in base_subject/base_body_html. Do NOT revert to generic phrases if a specific reference is available.
- Maintain the original call‑to‑action: friendly invite to a quick call, noting they’ll fill a short form for a tailored audit/game plan.

Safety / deliverability:
- Exclude spammy terms and patterns: free, discount, guaranteed, guarantee, bonus, sale, special offer, no obligation, risk-free, click here, instant, act now, urgent, limited time, last chance, hurry, exclusive offer, priority, final hours, winner, prize, deal, cash, earn, easy money, get rich quick, credit, debt, refinance, investment, miracle, secret, scientifically proven, weight loss, congratulations, offer expires, apply now, order now, call now.
- Do not use RE:, FWD:, ALL CAPS, emojis, or excessive punctuation (!!!). No brackets [] {} <>.
- Do not invent facts or specific metrics. Avoid hallucinations.

Output:
- Return ONLY a JSON object with exactly two keys: "subject" and "body_html".
- The subject should stay aligned with the body and remain concise; the dedicated subject personalizer will finalize it.
