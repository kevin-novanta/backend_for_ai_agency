Write a short, warm cold outreach email (under 110 words) with a casual, human tone.

Start with a warm, friendly greeting.

Make the tone feel like reaching out to someone you already have a light connection with—avoid sounding overly promotional or spammy.

Mention "Outbound Accelerator" exactly once in the body.

Include a short, friendly breakdown of what Outbound Accelerator does: building AI-powered workflow infrastructure for business owners to automate specific tasks, cut down labor costs, and potentially replace entire teams/hiring through advanced AI systems.

Mention that Outbound Accelerator helps companies like theirs by offering these benefits.

If personalization data from CSV columns like `Company Name` and `Custom 2` is available, smoothly integrate it without creating awkward sentence constructions.

Use this personalization to highlight how Outbound Accelerator could specifically help that type of company based on the offer summary, rather than just inserting the company name directly.

Use the offer summary as inspiration for tailoring the opening value statement, not as a verbatim insert.

Keep the explanation simple but confident, showing value without being hypey.

End with a friendly call to action: invite them to book a call for a free audit and game plan for building an AI workflow system that could help replace or optimize a specific part of their company.

Mention that they’ll be asked to fill out a short form before the call to help tailor the solution.

Ensure each sentence is followed by a blank line (like a normal email paragraph break).
